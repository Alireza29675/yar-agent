Study the directory at path: {{directory}}

## Initial Context Gathering

1. **Check for README**: First, look for README files (README.md, README.txt, etc.) in the target directory to understand what this directory is about.

2. **Parent Context**: If no README is found in the target directory, check parent directories for README files to understand the broader project context. This helps you understand where this directory fits within a larger project structure.

3. **External References**: If this directory references code, imports, or dependencies outside of itself, briefly explore those locations to understand the connections and dependencies.

Note: You don't need to provide detailed analysis of parent directories or external code - just enough context to understand how this directory fits into the bigger picture and what its purpose is.

## Thorough Analysis

Develop a comprehensive understanding of this directory and its contents by exploring recursively. Analyze:

- **Purpose & Functionality**: What this directory/codebase does
- **Structure & Architecture**: How it's organized and designed
- **Dependencies**: What it depends on and how
- **Key Components**: Important files, modules, and their relationships
- **Patterns & Conventions**: Coding patterns, architectural decisions

## Report Format

Provide your analysis in the following format:

### Overview
[High-level summary of what this directory is and does]

### Structure
[Directory organization and key components]

### Architecture & Patterns
[Design patterns, architectural decisions, conventions]

### Dependencies & Integrations
[What it depends on and how it connects to other parts]

### Key Insights
[Important observations, notable implementation details]

### Open Questions & Uncertainties
[Parts you're uncertain about, ambiguities in the code, areas that need clarification, or aspects where you'd benefit from more context]

The "Open Questions & Uncertainties" section is important - be honest about what you don't fully understand or what seems ambiguous.
