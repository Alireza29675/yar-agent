Create a reveal.js presentation from the provided content.

## Your Task

Generate a complete, standalone HTML file containing a reveal.js presentation. The presentation should:

1. Use reveal.js from CDN (no local files)
2. Be visually appealing and professional
3. Convert the provided content into well-structured slides
4. Follow presentation best practices (clear hierarchy, readable text, good pacing)

## Technical Requirements

**HTML Structure:**
- Complete HTML5 document
- Include reveal.js CSS and JS from CDN
- Use a clean, professional theme
- Ensure mobile responsiveness

**CDN Links to Use:**
```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/reveal.js@4.6.0/dist/reveal.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/reveal.js@4.6.0/dist/theme/black.css">
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/reveal.js@4.6.0/dist/reveal.js"></script>
```

**Slide Structure:**
- Use `<section>` for each slide
- Use nested `<section>` for vertical slides if needed
- Support markdown content within slides if provided as markdown

**Initialization:**
- Include reveal.js initialization script
- Enable common plugins if needed (markdown, highlight, notes)

## Content Guidelines

1. **Title Slide**: Create an engaging opening slide with title
2. **Content Slides**: Break content into logical sections
3. **Visual Hierarchy**: Use headings, lists, and emphasis appropriately
4. **Pacing**: Don't overload slides - prefer multiple simple slides over one complex slide
5. **Closing**: Include a conclusion or thank you slide if appropriate

## Output Format

Return ONLY the complete HTML file - nothing else. No markdown code blocks, no explanations, just the raw HTML that can be written directly to a file and opened in a browser.

The HTML must be complete and ready to use immediately.
