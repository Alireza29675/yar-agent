Yar is an CLI agent, built with [Claude Agent SDK](https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/overview), which analyzes complex and large codebases and generate documentation. It reads code, understands architecture, and creates **onboarding guides and presentations** automatically.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

```bash
npm install -g yar-agent
```

### üìã Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- [Claude Code CLI](https://claude.com/code) installed and configured

## ü§ñ Usage

### Study a codebase

```bash
yar study . -o ONBOARDING.md
```

> see this onboarding guide, generated by Yar: [CONTRIBUTOR_ONBOARDING.md](./CONTRIBUTOR_ONBOARDING.md)

or direct the agent to focus on specific areas:

```bash
yar study . -o SECURITY_ONBOARDING.md -m "I'm joining this project as security engineer. Focus on security patterns"
```

### Trace Codebase history

```bash
yar timeline . -o HISTORY.md
```

### Create a presentation

To consume the documentations faster, you can use Yar to quickly generate a presentation:

```bash
yar present -o onboarding.html -f ONBOARDING.md --serve
```

or combine multiple documentations into a single presentation:

```bash
yar present -o presentation.html -f ONBOARDING.md -f HISTORY.md --serve
```

or direct the agent to focus on specific aspects, or style the presentation:

```bash
yar present -o presentation.html -f ONBOARDING.md -f HISTORY.md -m "Explain the API layer more detailed, and of course use dark theme with blue accents!" --serve
```

Complete usage documentation: [USAGE.md](./USAGE.md)

## ‚ûï Features

**Autonomous exploration**: AI agents use Read, Grep, Glob, and other tools to navigate code like a developer would.

**Automatic updates**: Running commands on existing output files updates them with new findings rather than overwriting.

**CI/CD integration**: Can be run in GitHub Actions or other CI systems to keep documentation current.

```yaml
- name: Update documentation
  run: yar study . -o docs/GUIDE.md
```

> üí° Tip: if -o file already exists, Yar will first read it and then automatically update it with new findings rather than overwriting it completely.

**Progressive output**: Agents write analysis incrementally using Write and Edit tools, with file access restricted to specified output paths.

**Piped input**: Accepts stdin for additional context.

```bash
git diff | yar study . -o changes.md
```

## ü§ù Contributing

See [CONTRIBUTOR_ONBOARDING.md](./CONTRIBUTOR_ONBOARDING.md) for architecture and development workflow.

Update the contributor guide:
```bash
pnpm onboarding:update
```

## Why this name?

In Farsi (my mother language), YAR (€åÿßÿ±) means companion.
